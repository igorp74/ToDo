# ToDo
Simple CLI app for task management with SQLite as a backend.


## ‚öôÔ∏è BUILD:

### Prerequisites:
1. Installed GO

### Process
1. Create a folder for your Golang workspace (i.e. **ws_todo**)
2. Create a folder for source data (i.e. **todo**)
3. Copy files to **todo** folder
4. Open shell in **ws_todo** folder and type:
   
   `go mod init todo/app`
     
   `go mod tidy`
6. Enter todo folder and type:

   `go build`
8. Depends on environment, you will get the todo.exe on Windows or todo on Linux

   `todo add -t "Test"`   (on Windows)
    
   `./todo add -t "Test"` (on Linux)

    This last step will create **todo.db** in your home folder
10. Save the executable/binary in folder that is on system path
    * `sudo cp todo /usr/local/bin` (on Linux)
  
    * Or add your path to the environment variable (Windows)
    * `setx /M PATH "%PATH%;<your-new-path>"`

# üé¨ Examples

Adding task could be light at first:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f672fa5e-3e2e-420a-9471-56fcafa457c4)

Let's see how app will display entered tasks

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6873cf1c-b5a7-45b4-b292-6e3e5fa11c5e)

## Update tasks
Now, we can start grouping tasks into projects, adding tags, which can be useful for tagging a team, a ticket or whatever key word that has some meaning to you

![Screenshot_20250614_105430](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fb57a76-00b8-41b9-9826-10b9cb462bb2)

Also, we can add contexts, which are similar as tags and they are here for better granulation of meta-data around your tasks

![Screenshot_20250614_110615](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8406ff9-1f98-4e5d-b838-e6a8cabeb4e0)

## Display formats

OK, with some content we can display tasks in 3 format: 

**Default** - this format shows all relevant data related to tasks formated to be functional and logical

![Screenshot_20250614_113927](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fba8d3db-97e2-4e91-ae2a-c510d9218ee8)

**Compact** - Keeps more relevant details about tasks, and hide details like start - end times. For clearer overview

![Screenshot_20250614_114117](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a66508ee-c46f-4df9-8c64-5d87945e0511)

**Minimal** - this one is suitable for large number of tasks overview, only task title and project related

![Screenshot_20250614_114144](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/279f0454-05a3-4747-89dc-e18cec510396)

## Durations

With flag -E we will end tasks with the current timestamp as the end date

![Screenshot_20250614_115231](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efdbbf4e-624b-4eea-8f38-968e10f4be95)

But, wait a minute... where is duration in working hours ?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9f82af1-0f35-4027-807c-48ec5a0dec12)

We need to define working hours first. It could be different for every day in the week, including weekends. So it is up to you how you will define it.

Once defined, it should be working...

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f581dfbb-6179-4689-bc27-56f9adb159b7)

But noo, still nothing... This time we cannot even see **Task 1** on the list.

This is because `todo list` command, by default lists only tasks with `pending` status (not finished). So, let's list task with all statuses `-st all`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/621ec296-0f97-4cb4-8907-f1d8a8422522)

Again, no working hours ?! Let's double check the time... Task starts on Saturday and ends on Saturday as well... 

Is it Saturday defined in working hours ? Of course no! A-haa! üòÄ Let's move start time to some working day:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba33f816-e547-4d9d-98c5-6383f219f216)

Finally! That is it. I can see duration in working hours.

### When I need to wait for something or someone...

What if I have delay in the process ? Let's say I need to wait for someone else to do something before I can continue. Maybe I need to wait for IT department for access to something...
We can define **start waiting** `-sw` and **end waiting** `-ew` times during the task duration:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5aea4c2-65dd-4486-9135-66944a2872fe)

And you may see the different duration now. But working hours are the same. Yes, I want it that way.I might change it later, though.

## Notes
Notes are not the same as task descriptions. They are similar, but notes have timestamps and descriptions and you may enter them as many as you like. Notes are useful for tracking parts of the tasks and saving your personal remarks along the task journey. You may display them (all or n last ones) or not.
Number of notes is unlimited (well, this is not entirely true, since you may hit SQLite limit of 281 terabytes, who knows... Some people are notoholics. There is nothing wrong in that.)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dec43c81-2e4b-4b36-ad9f-58cbdafa9b73)

Notes will not be displayed by default. You need to enter the `-n all` flag for showing all notes, or `-n 2` to show only last 2 notes, for example.
